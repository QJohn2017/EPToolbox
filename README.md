This is a bag of mixed tricks for *Mathematica*. It currently contains the following:

 - A complex trascendental equation solver documented in [this Mathematica Stack Exchange thread](http://mathematica.stackexchange.com/a/57821).
 - The quasirandom number generators the solver depends on.
 - The contour plot cleaner function developed by [Szabolcs Horv√°t](http://mathematica.stackexchange.com/users/12/szabolcs) and originally posted on [this Mathematica Stack Exchange thread](http://mathematica.stackexchange.com/a/3279) under a CC-BY-SA license.
 - The dynamics profiler developed by [Rui Rojo](http://mathematica.stackexchange.com/users/109/rojo) and originally posted at [this Mathematica Stack Exchange thread](http://mathematica.stackexchange.com/a/8047) under a CC-BY-SA license.
